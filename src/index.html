            <p>
            Antonio Canova’s statue The Three Graces is a Neoclassical sculpture,
            in marble, of the mythological three Charites, daughters of Zeus – identified on
            some engravings of the statue as, from left to right, Euphrosyne, Aglaea and Thalia –
            who were said to represent youth/beauty (Thalia), mirth (Euphrosyne), and elegance (Aglaea).
            The Graces presided over banquets and gatherings, to delight the guests of the gods.

                She was venerated as the goddess of beauty, splendor, glory, magnificence, and adornment.
                She is the youngest of the Charites according to Hesiod. Aglaea is one of three daughters
                of Zeus and either the Oceanid Eurynome, or of Eunomia, the goddess of good order and lawful conduct.

            <h1>The Making</h1>
            <p>
            Canova's assistants roughly blocked out the marble, leaving Canova to perform the final carving
            and shape the stone to highlight the Graces soft flesh. This was a trademark of the artist, and
            the piece shows a strong allegiance to the Neo-Classical movement in sculpture, of which Canova
            is the prime exponent.<br /><br />
            The three goddesses are shown nude, huddled together, their heads almost touching in what many have
            referred to as an erotically charged piece. They stand, leaning slightly inward — perhaps discussing
            a common issue, or simply enjoying their closeness. Their hair-styles are similar, braided atop their heads.
